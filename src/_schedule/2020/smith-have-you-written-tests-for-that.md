“Have you written tests for that?” is a question sometimes feared by developers. There are so many approaches, libraries and methodologies that it can be hard to know where to even start.

We’ll build and test a real web application to cut through the breadth of testing options to understand how we can test each component of our application in isolation and as an end to end product.

Once we know how to test our functionality, it’s time to make sure our user experience and design are also tested! We will learn how to ensure our apps work in every browser, responsively and pixel perfect.

Finally, we need to answer the original question and to do that we will learn how exterminating mutants can guarantee that we have written good tests for our web application.
