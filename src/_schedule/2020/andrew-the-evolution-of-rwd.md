We typically understand responsive design as being fluid grids, flexible images and media queries - these being the elements detailed in [Ethan Marcotte's original _A List Apart_ article](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) on responsive web design.

Over the last few years however we have been handed a whole set of new tools in CSS which allow our sites to respond to the environment of our user, and the shape of the content we are displaying. In this talk I will take a look at how new layout supports flexible grids and content-based sizing. I'll share how the new generation of Media Queries are about so much more than just viewport size, and how we can use the tools we have to really place the person using our site at the heart of the decisions we make.
