Arenâ€™t Design Tokens just spicy Sass variables?

Design Tokens allow you to define the low-level values of the design attributes in your Design System so that they can become the part of a shared vocabulary amongst all of Systems users and used across all of the products within Design System.

In this talk Stuart will be discussing what types of design attributes you could find in a set of Design Tokens, how you can create them once and share them anywhere, look beyond their generic usage across organisations, and how they can empower everyone to contribute to the overall Design System.
