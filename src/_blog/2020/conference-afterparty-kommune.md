Thanks to the generosity of [our fantastic sponsors](/sponsors/), we are hosting an after party at [Kommune](http://kommune.co.uk/) just down the road from The Crucible.

Kommune is located in Castle House and is home to a delicious variety of local food and drink vendors. From hoppy IPAs to fancy cocktails and mocktails, and wood-fired pizzas to seared tuna, there's something to suit everyone's tastes and dietary needs.

See you then!

The small print:

- Please keep the wristband you will be given in the morning.
- Kommune does not accept cash payment: bring a payment card with you if you plan on making purchases.
- Due to venue licensing restrictions, this event is only for people aged 18 and over.

We've added these details to the [Venue page](/venue/) for reference.
