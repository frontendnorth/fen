title: "Announcing our finalised speaker line-up"
date: 2019-12-12
intro: "After completing our CFP process, we are now able to share our exciting choices."

Back in September [we opened our Call for Proposals (CFP) process](/blog/2019/09/apply-to-speak-at-front-end-north-2020/) and encouraged the community to apply to speak at Front End North. As organisers, we were all heartened to see such a positive response: it allowed us to pick from a **diverse range of interesting talks**.

We followed our CFP process and have been able add **another four speakers** to the four we had already handpicked before opening the CFP.

FEN is a community-focused industry conference and we think that this is reflected in our line up. We think that [our low ticket price]({{ metadata.ticket_url }}) - combined with the range of topics and speakers we have - represents both good value for money and a worthwhile use of your time as busy web professionals!

Our CFP speakers are:

- [Laura Gonzalez](/speakers/laura-gonzalez/), javascript harlequin, Facebook: Guerrilla Design Systems
- [Stuart Robson](/speakers/stuart-robson/), Front end developer, alwaystwisted: Design Tokens and CSS
- [Jemima Abu](/speakers/jemima-abu/), Front end developer, Telesoftas: Let's Get Functional
- [Mike Smith](/speakers/mike-smith/), Web Developer, Oxbotica: Have you written tests for that?

We thank everyone for applying to speak at Front End North. If you were not picked, but still want an opportunity to speak at industry events, then [Front End Sheffield](https://www.meetup.com/Front-End-Sheffield/) would be very happy to hear from you (or reach out to the organisers [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/frontendsheff)).

[Tickets are available to all for Â£50 each]({{ metadata.ticket_url}}).
