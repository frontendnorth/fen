title: Volunteering to help at FEN 2020
intro: "Your opportunity to help us make this year's conference a success."
updated: 2019-11-23

We have set out to provide a conference with great speakers who will deliver insightful talks at an accessible price. You can read more about [the intentions behind Front End North in our blog post](https://frontendnorth.com/blog/2019/10/rebooting-front-end-north/). But to do this **we need volunteers to help us**. This is where you may come in!


## Why get involved?

- The opportunity to work alongside what we think will be a **supportive and helpful** team.
- You'll be helping an event that is determined to **promote Sheffield** as a good place to be for web design, development and associated fields.
- We are aiming to organise volunteer roles in such a way that volunteers will hopefully be able to watch at least half of the talks.
- Support a [team of organisers](/blog/2019/10/rebooting-front-end-north/#meet-the-organisers) who strongly believe in the embetterment of the industry in the North.
- Undying gratitude from a genuinely appreciative team of organisers!


## Some of the help we'll be looking for on the day

- Welcoming attendees on arrival and check their tickets.
- Tend to the reception desk throughout the day.
- Be a buddy for a speaker - i.e. the point person for that speaker so they have a friendly member of the team to support them.
- Forwarding any [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) concerns to the organisers.
- Generally being available to help the event run smoothly from the organisers (from a "We need this done!" perspective) and assisting attendees with questions they have.


## How we'll help you to confidently help us

You'll need to be **available for a group training session sometime during January** for a couple of hours, as well as on the 7th of February (the day of the conference). This training will be delivered remotely with help from [Katie Fenn](https://twitter.com/katie_fenn) who has helped other conferences with their CoC responsibilities.

<a href="{{ metadata.volunteer_form }}" class="c-button c-button--pop">Register your interest in volunteering</a>

The deadline for this is the 5th of January and we will be in touch very shortly after then.

If you're not 100% sure about volunteering, then please do [put your name down]({{ metadata.volunteer_form }}) or reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frontendnorth). We'll get in touch and you can talk about it with us first - we won't hold people to being a volunteer!

It should go without saying, but we would not expect any volunteer to pay for a conference ticket. Whilst we are unable to pay you for any expenses, you will receive a volunteer pass. We are sorry but all volunteers must all be over 18.

If you don't want to volunteer but still like the sound of what we're doing, [then tickets are available now](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/front-end-north-conference-tickets-78898540659) for Â£50.

Thanks to [Peter Aitken](/speakers/peter-aitken/) for help with some of this.

**Added 23rd November:** Updated to reflect that remote training is a possibility for volunteers.
