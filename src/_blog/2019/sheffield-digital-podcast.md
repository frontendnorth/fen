As supporters of all things digital locally, Sheffield Digital recently interviewed two of our FEN organisers, Katie Fenn and Amy Benson.

They provide background to the planning of our upcoming February conference, as well as sharing some history of the [Front End Sheffield](https://www.meetup.com/Front-End-Sheffield/) meetup:

> Earlier this year, they took over the reins of the also very popular Front End North conference, which takes place on 7th February 2020 at the marvellous Crucible Theatre.
>
> In this episode, you get to hear all about their journey as meetup organisers, as well as their plans for Front End North. Fancy getting involved? They are on the lookout now for volunteers, lightning talk speakers and, of course, people to buy tickets!
