A certain global health crisis plus various life events meant that we weren’t able to schedule the next Front End North as soon as we’d hoped, but now things have calmed down a bit we’re very happy to announce that Front End North will be back in Summer 2025!

## What’s new?

We have a new fully accessible city centre venue - details coming soon.

We’ve had some team changes, it’s still the [Front End Sheffield](https://www.meetup.com/Front-End-Sheffield/) team, but Laura and JP have moved on to other things (though we’ll totally be roping them in as volunteers) and we (Katie, Ian and Amy) have been joined by Tom and Lee.

## What’s the same?

Front End North will continue to be a grassroots, affordable and accessible event.

We’ll be running a call for papers programme with an anonymised talk selection process.

## What’s next?

We’re still in the early stages of planning but hope to have some more info available soon.
