Mike Smith lives in Oxford where he works as part of the web team at Oxbotica helping make autonomous vehicles. He is passionate about testing the web and regularly gets more excited about testing the code than writing it!

When not writing tests he can be found listening to and making music, watching motorsport and ice skating.
